RSI:
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a popular momentum oscillator used in technical analysis to measure the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. An RSI value above 70 generally indicates that a stock is overbought, suggesting a potential pullback or correction, while a value below 30 indicates that a stock is oversold, potentially signaling a buying opportunity. By analyzing RSI values, traders can make more informed decisions about entry and exit points, enhancing their ability to predict stock price movements and optimize their investment strategies.

MACD:
The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator used in technical analysis to signal potential buy and sell opportunities. It is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The resulting line, known as the MACD line, is then compared to a 9-period EMA of the MACD line, called the signal line. When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it generates a bullish signal, suggesting it might be a good time to buy. Conversely, when the MACD line crosses below the signal line, it produces a bearish signal, indicating it might be a good time to sell. Additionally, the distance between the MACD line and the signal line, known as the MACD histogram, can provide further insight into the strength of the trend. By utilizing the MACD, traders can better identify changes in market momentum and make more informed trading decisions.

BOLLINGER BAND:
Bollinger Bands are a versatile and widely used technical analysis tool that helps traders understand price volatility and identify potential overbought or oversold conditions. Developed by John Bollinger, these bands consist of three lines: the middle band, which is a simple moving average (SMA) of the asset's price, and two outer bands, which are typically set two standard deviations above and below the SMA. When the price moves closer to the upper band, the asset may be overbought, indicating a possible sell signal. Conversely, when the price approaches the lower band, the asset may be oversold, suggesting a potential buying opportunity. The distance between the upper and lower bands expands and contracts with market volatility, providing traders with valuable information about market conditions. By incorporating Bollinger Bands into their analysis, traders can make more informed decisions and better anticipate potential price movements.

VOLUME:
Volume is a crucial metric in technical analysis, representing the total number of shares or contracts traded for a security during a given period. It provides insight into the strength or weakness of a price movement. High trading volume often indicates strong investor interest and can confirm the direction of a price trend, signaling that the current trend is likely to continue. Conversely, low trading volume may suggest a lack of conviction among traders, indicating that a price movement might be weakening or about to reverse. Analyzing volume alongside other indicators, such as price patterns and momentum oscillators, helps traders validate trends and make more informed trading decisions. By understanding and monitoring trading volume, traders can gain a deeper insight into market dynamics and improve the accuracy of their stock predictions.

LSTM MODEL:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) particularly effective for time series forecasting due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies and patterns in sequential data. Unlike traditional RNNs, LSTMs can remember information for extended periods, which is crucial for predicting stock prices based on historical data. LSTMs achieve this through their unique architecture, which includes memory cells and gating mechanisms that control the flow of information. These models can learn and remember important features from the data, making them well-suited for handling the complexity and non-linearity of financial time series. By using LSTM models to analyze past stock prices and other relevant indicators, traders can generate more accurate forecasts, identify trends, and make better-informed investment decisions.
