RSI:
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a popular momentum oscillator used in technical analysis to measure the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. An RSI value above 70 generally indicates that a stock is overbought, suggesting a potential pullback or correction, while a value below 30 indicates that a stock is oversold, potentially signaling a buying opportunity. By analyzing RSI values, traders can make more informed decisions about entry and exit points, enhancing their ability to predict stock price movements and optimize their investment strategies.

MACD:
The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator used in technical analysis to signal potential buy and sell opportunities. It is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The resulting line, known as the MACD line, is then compared to a 9-period EMA of the MACD line, called the signal line. When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it generates a bullish signal, suggesting it might be a good time to buy. Conversely, when the MACD line crosses below the signal line, it produces a bearish signal, indicating it might be a good time to sell. Additionally, the distance between the MACD line and the signal line, known as the MACD histogram, can provide further insight into the strength of the trend. By utilizing the MACD, traders can better identify changes in market momentum and make more informed trading decisions.
