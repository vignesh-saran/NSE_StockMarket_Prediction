RSI:
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a popular momentum oscillator used in technical analysis to measure the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. An RSI value above 70 generally indicates that a stock is overbought, suggesting a potential pullback or correction, while a value below 30 indicates that a stock is oversold, potentially signaling a buying opportunity. By analyzing RSI values, traders can make more informed decisions about entry and exit points, enhancing their ability to predict stock price movements and optimize their investment strategies.
